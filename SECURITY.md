## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities via [Github Issues](https://github.com/isp-nexus/universe/issues).

If possible, please include...

- Version of Nexus you're using
- The runtime you're using (Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Node, Browser)
- Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue
- What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
- Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring
- A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally
  - **Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.
- Errors from either your server, or from the browser's Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

If the you believe the vulnerability is time-sensitive or requires additional support, please reach out to `hello [at] isp.nexus`
