# Nexus Core

This package contains a collection of modules that provide a common functionality without substantial external dependencies. Generally, the modules in this package are not intended to be used directly, but rather are used internally within other Nexus packages.

Core modules do not require a specific JavaScript runtime, and can be used in Node.js, browser, or Web Worker environments. For modules that require Node.js-specific functionality, see `@isp.nexus/sdk`.
